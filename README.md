Basic HTML Front End

Simple Web Site Frontend
Quinn Cheng

A website about collectibles.

Website is used by going to the home page and having navigation to three pages.
Two of the three pages contain products by their respective companies.
The last page is a Contact Us page that lets them get in contact to answer questions about collectibles.

HTML, CSS, PHP, Bootstrap, and Javascript were used.
CSS was used to center the images.
Bootstrap was used to create the navigation bar on the top of the screen as well as for some form inputs and to validate the email section of the form.
Javascript was used to script the validation checks for the Name and Comments.
PHP was used to pull the information out of the form.

Ideas for future improvement is to try and integrate more of Bootstrap as my understanding of it is still limited at this point. 

I also want to learn more on how to integrate style sheets in conjunction with Bootstrap as I don't really understand how to use CSS with Bootstrap in its totality.

I want to make the site more dynamic but am not really sure what to add to make a website more dynamic.

Want to learn how to integrate CSS more as well to try and space things better and to fill negative space.
